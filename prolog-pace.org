* Introduction

  - Pace Layers in Brand's /Clock of the Long Now/
  - Shearing Layers in Brand's /How Buildings Learn/ 
  - Firehose --> Otium

the future is already here, it's just not evenly
distributed.

* Issues

How to different layers communicate with each other?

Lower layers act as a brake for upper layers which don't
allow the layer above it stray too far or too fast

* Layer Models

Brand's Pacing Layers

  - fashion & art
  - commerce
  - governance
  - infrastructure
  - nature

Brand's Architectual Shearing Layers

  - stuff
  - space plan
  - services
  - skin
  - structure
  - landscape
  - site

Paul Saffo's Pacing Layers

  - Anthropos
  - Bios
  - Lithos :: literally /of stone/
  - Cosmos

People today don't understand shearing -- they think everything is
happening at the same speed -- that everything is simultaneous --
there is no separation of layers -- it's all a firehose that doesn't
give you a chance to think about the next hour, let alone tomorrow.


* Content
 - Core    :: project design, organization & management
 - Trivium :: prerequisite skills and knowledge
 - Prolog  :: discursive introduction
 - Primer  :: core code & knowledge to build and maintain civilization
   - identity :: 
   - pace     :: 
   - holon    :: 
   - scope    :: 
 - Hoard   :: recorded memory and experience
 
* Fashion & Art
 - firehose -- real-time
* Commerce
 - near real-time
----
 - kinto        :: 
 - bento        :: 

* Governance
 - collective -- asynchronous
----
Humans naturally organize themselves into:

 - states
 - nations
 - tribes
 - families & groups
 - individuals
 - roles

But today we have:

 - empires (PRC, Soviet Union) -- if an empire can stay together long
   enough it sometimes can become a nation-state.  The United States
   did it, Soviet Union fell apart before it could do it, China is
   still trying to do it.  Rome almost did it 
 - nation-states
 - regions (states)
 - areas (counties & districts)
 - settlements (cities, towns and villages)
 - neighborhoods
 - individuals

What we need to work towards is:

 - solar
 - planetary
 - bioregional
 - neighborhoods
 - families & groups 
 - individuals
 - roles

* Infrastructure
Loosely based on TCP 7 Layer Stack

  - Application     :: Otium 
    - Interface
    - Message Layer :: message & storage
    - Transaction   :: blockchain
  - Transport       :: UDP, TCP
  - Network         :: Internet layer
  - Physical        :: ethernet, sneakernet, Token, Ring, Mesh
    - tool          :: computer, toaster, fridge, oven, aircon
    - machine       :: routers, switches, pumps, fans, motors
    - transport     :: pipes, wires, space
    - payload       :: radio, sound, microwave, light, water,
                       electricity, gas etc.
** Culture
 - philosophy :: world models (includes religion)
 - language   :: written and spoken
 - mythos     :: written and spoken
 - memory     :: collective knowledge
*** Polis      :: complex societies   10K


A civilization = cultivation + settlement


* Nature
** Anthropos  :: species             2-10M
** Bios       :: life on earth       3-4B
** Lithos     :: geological          lifetime of a solar system
** Cosmos     :: stellar             lifetime of the universe
