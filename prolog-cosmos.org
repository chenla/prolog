* Introduction

How many times have I tried to avoid writing this damn thing.  But
without a stated cosmology you don't have a statement of the
assumptions about the universe and the nature of reality that you are
using to base everything else on.

It's not enough to give /another/ overview of the standard model and
be done with it.  Too much is changing -- and I suspect that ten years
from now our understanding of the universe will not so much invalidate
what we understand today as much as open a broader understanding that
could well be as bizzare as Quantum mechanics.

* It From Bit

#+begin_quote
every it—every particle, every field of force, even the space-time
continuum itself—derives its function, its meaning, its very existence
... from bits.

-- John Archibald Wheeler, /It From Bit/
#+end_quote


  - John Wheeler and his paper It From Bit
  - Bennett -- The Thermodynamics of Information
  - Landauer -- Information is Physical
  - reversable operations (flipping bits from one to zero) don't
    generate heat -- irreversible operations (deleting) does.
  - QM is all about information:

#+begin_quote 
Why does nature appear quantized? Because information is
quantized. The bit is the ultimate unsplittable particle.

-- The Information pp231
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
When a bit flips from zero to one, or vice-versa, the information is
preserved. The process is reversible. Entropy is unchanged; no heat
needs to be dissipated. Only an irreversible operation, he argued,
increases entropy.

-- The Information p233.
#+end_quote
  
  - the universe is made from information that depends on the
    universality of computation -- it can be created, destroyed or
    copied.
  - information is generated every time there is a quantum event
  - the universe is structured hierachically

** Holons are isotropic

Every is at the center of the universe from it's point of view.

** The Middle

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe][Observable universe]] | Wikipedia
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length][Planck length]] | Wikipedia


Humans are about in the middle (geometric mean) in terms of scale:

  - the size of the observable universe 10^25m
  - living cell 10^-5 --> about half way
  - planck length 10^−35m
