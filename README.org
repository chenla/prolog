* Prolegomenon

Dictionaries define a /prolegomenon/ as a discursive introduction; a map
of a territory.  But sometimes the territory is so expansive that the
map that models it is great enough to warrant a map of it's own... 
Ranganathan's Prolegomenon was such an introduction.  Wordsworth's
/Prelude/ ate up so much that the /Recluse/ was never completed....

I fear that this will be the fate of my humble literate computational
prolegomena as well.

The idea is that these texts can be used to construct a number of
narratives that can be published in traditional formats to act as a
bridge, or at least a beartrap that drops you down the rabbit hole.

Beware the pointy bits at the bottom when you land...
