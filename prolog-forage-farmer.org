The general idea is that the people settled down during the
agricultural revolution a new way of thinking was required.  

#+begin_quote
Farming required huge behavior changes, mostly unnatural to
foragers. A key enabler seems to have been increased self-control to
follow social norms. But what allowed this increased self-control?

Farming is all about land, and possession of land, which is why we use
property to mean both land and any goods that you possess.  A farmer
invests a great deal of time and effort into their farm, and if
someone takes that away, it is a great loss for the farmer because
it's not easy to move somewhere else, find land that no one is using
and then start from scratch.  So fear of loosing land is at the heart
of farming.  Women and children were all tied up with property as
well.  Because children would get your property after your death, it
was important to be very clear whose children your wife bore.  Defense
of property required large strong men who could fight.  Farmers are
not exactly ideal warriors, so farmers would band together into groups
and pay for protection from strongmen, warlords, and later kings and
even later, states.  Because the warrior class was under the control
of the king or state, and that they had a monopoly on use of force,
they eventually took over and farmers became subject to the warrior
class.  Religions changed from being animistic, to being personified
dieties who ruled mankind the way the kings rules the farmers.  But
these new gods were always angry as people when they disobeyed or
broke the rules.  At the root of all of this was the threat of death
by the gods, or more likely by the followers of the gods who would
punish you on their behalf.

#+begin_quote
One source was moving from vague spirituality to religions with
powerful and morally-outraged gods who punish norm violators. In
addition (as Iâ€™ll explain tomorrow), high densities and larger social
networks made stronger credible threats to ostracize folks for
specific deviant acts.  Yes both these mechanisms require the fear
that norm violations could lead to great harm, even death. But for
poor farmers living on edge, such threats were easy to come by.

Interestingly, this death-threat pressure could work even without
farmers being conscious of the relevant threats or fears. In fact,
farming society probably worked better with homo hypocritus farmers,
consciously denying that strong social pressures pushed them to do
what would otherwise feel unnatural.

Belief in these systems became the bedrock of the system.  Money was
invented as a intermediate token system for trading goods in markets
of people who you may or may not know.  Because of the flexibility of
money, it became as important as land, and people were scared to loose
it or have it taken away because it's loss would hurt them.  So kings
and states, ended up issuing money, and backing it up with the warrior
class.  But in the end, the whole system is built on fear used to keep
people in their place and force them to do what the more powerful
wanted.

Foragers don't have this problem.  They could move any time.  So if
there are places where they can go to forage, it doesn't matter if
they find other people foraging where they had been before.  Foraging
bands have often had friendly relationships with neighboring bands, so
long as there was enough resources to support all bands.  Possessions
were limited because they had to be carried from place to place, so
there wasn't an investment in land and possessions that would hurt
them if they were lost.  Bands were larger than a family, and it was
likely that partnering was a bit more looser than for farmers.
