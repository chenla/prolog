* Introduction


#+begin_quote
There’s only meaning where there’s prior agreement about our
symbols. And all communication is like this, from waves sent over
electrical wires, to the letters agreed upon to symbolize words, to
the words agreed upon to symbolize things.

#+begin_quote
The real measure of information is not in the symbols we send— it’s in
the symbols we could have sent, but did not. To send a message is to
make a selection from a pool of possible symbols, and “at each
selection there are eliminated all of the other symbols which might
have been chosen.” To choose is to kill off alternatives. Symbols from
large vocabularies bear more information than symbols from small
ones. Information measures freedom of choice.
