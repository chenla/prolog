* Plan of the Work

** The Yellow Brick Road
  - Prolegomenon
  - Trivium
    - grammer
    - logic
    - rhetoric
  - Quadrivium
    - mimesis
    - rhizomata
    - systema
    - transacta
** Cyclical Natures of Things
- Cosmic    :: Big Bang, inflation, formation of galaxies 
- Galactic  :: galactic year, birth and death of stars
- Solar     :: 
- Planetary :: hot house, ice-house, vulcanism, impacts, solar
               and cosmic radiation, evolutionary, extinctions
- Human     :: rise, decline, fall, collapse
** The Library of Last Resort
- Concepts
  - to forget and repeat
  - living memory vs. reinvention
  - context keeps stuff understandable
  - everything is either text, list or blob
  - everything is a narrative
  - no context, no meaning
  - data, information & knowledge
- Loss
  - disaster :: fire, flood, quake, electromagnetic, chemical
  - media migration
    - oral to written
    - scroll to codex
    - analog to digital
    - encoding to encoding
  - temporary insanity
    - ideological   :: purges causes by belief systems
    - political     :: hoarding of power and information
    - economic      :: similar to benign neglect, but deliberate
  - human error     :: accident, incompetance
  - benign neglect 
  - loss of context
  - extinction
- Context
  - communication is shared meaning
  - class vs individual
  - context is the sum of relationships within a finite set
  - level of detail
  - point of view
  - relationships
  - value and context
- Organization
  - organization is linguistic
    - symbols, words, sentences
  - organization reflects power
  - five ways to sort
   - sequence
   - magnitude
   - topic
   - time
   - place
  - data structures
    - tree
    - rhizome
    - directed graph
    - lists
    - maps
- Data Models
- Encoding
- Markup Strategies
  - serialization vs markup
  - written markup :: symbols, words, sentences, punctuation,
                      whitespace, indentation. paragraphs, sections,
                      divisions, documents. 
- Static vs Dynamic
  - machine readable vs machine understandable
  - executable text
  - pattern matching
  - recursion
- Strategies for Survival
  - lots of copies keep stuff safe
  - document and define everything
    - definitions set limits and boundries
    - 
  - staggered overlapping change :: 
    the idea being to keep long term archives in archival formats, 
    and languages which change slowly over very long time frames 
    form a bridge between short term linguistic drift happening 
    in the short term -- long time frames are 1,000 years.
  - copies beyond reach :: that can't be destroyed - like on the
         moon
  - archival copies :: lossless formats that preserve and are
         human readable, but not for consumption. Kept in a safe 
         place.
  - public copies :: in human consumable formats, that are subject
         to censorship, and access limits due to ideogies, politics,
         taboo and law.
  - staggered retention assesment :: don't save everything 
  - 
- Storage media
  - rock, clay, 
  - papryus, parchment, paper
  - analog audio, video
  - magnetic, 
  - binary
  - micro-etching
  - dna
