* Plan of the Work

#+begin_comment
the TOC is based on: 
  - NOTES <2014-06-10 Tue 12:22> Plan of Arc Nong Pao TOC

The Meta title for the work is /The Nature of Things/

It still hasn't quite gelled.  In a sense it's going on to
cover everything that the quadrivium didn't.  

In Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age, when a girl completed
the /Young Lady's Illustrated Primer/ it unlocked a library
of advanced books and areas of specific study in different
subjects and disciplines.  We don't see in any of these
books but they are not the same as the Primer.

But then, this isn't that either.  Rather this is meant to
be more like lifetime study plans, perhaps that's what
should be put into the work.  The base physics and even
philosophy included here will NOT be included in the
quadrivium.  If so then the scenarios that we need to
consider before planning the library of last resort are
actually the first part of LOLR, since having completed the
quadrivium, the reader will have a good grasp of cosmology,
physics, evolution, extinction events, climate change and
planetary biological systems.

  - The /The Yellow Brick Road/ prepares you for the journey and starts
    you down the road.
  - The /Library of Last Resort/ lays the groundwork for very long term
    scopic archives.
  - The /Plan of Arc Nong Pao/ is a detailed plan to put the library of
    last resort into action.

  - human error     :: accident, incompetance
  - benign neglect 
  - loss of context

  - level of detail
  - point of view
  - relationships
  - value and context
- Organization
  - organization is linguistic
    - symbols, words, sentences
  - organization reflects power

- Encoding
- Markup Strategies
  - serialization vs markup
  - written markup :: symbols, words, sentences, punctuation,
                      whitespace, indentation. paragraphs, sections,
                      divisions, documents. 
- Static vs Dynamic
  - machine readable vs machine understandable
  - executable text
  - pattern matching
  - recursion
- Strategies for Survival
  - lots of copies keep stuff safe
  - document and define everything
    - definitions set limits and boundries
    - 
  - staggered overlapping change :: 
    the idea being to keep long term archives in archival formats, 
    and languages which change slowly over very long time frames 
    form a bridge between short term linguistic drift happening 
    in the short term -- long time frames are 1,000 years.
  - copies beyond reach :: that can't be destroyed - like on the
         moon
  - archival copies :: lossless formats that preserve and are
         human readable, but not for consumption. Kept in a safe 
         place.
  - public copies :: in human consumable formats, that are subject
         to censorship, and access limits due to ideogies, politics,
         taboo and law.
  - staggered retention assesment :: don't save everything 
  - 
- Storage media

* Prolog to the Yellow Brick Road

based on text from: NOTES <2014-06-12 Thu 15:26> the yellow brick road begins

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, perhaps with
great planning and forethought, perhaps with a ceremonial send off
with a song, garlands and perhaps a little dance.  Or it may start
with little more than a sigh, and a change in mindset as the traveler
moves from a world of the familiar into that weird world of
transition, where one no longer is any one place, except that which
she had brought with her.  The destination is an ideal, an illusory
goal that may or may not be real.  Because once you have stepped onto
the road, there is no way to know where it might take you, or for how
long, or how changed you will be when you arrive at your destination.
And even if you do arrive at your destination, and step into another
world, you are not the same as when you left.  And if you do return,
by way of another journey, to where you began, it will no longer exist
any more than the person who had left it exists any longer.  All
journeys are, in a very real sense of the word, one-way.  The journey
is a process, and your consciousness is an ever changing evolving
thing.  You are not just one person, you are many different people
over a life time, and there is never going back, any more than
memories of past places, and past lives are static precise snapshots
of what something was.  Memory is always in the process of reinventing
the past to reflect the present context, and meaning derives from that
context which is a living dynamic changing thing in constant churn and
flux.

This puts the lie to the illusion of time as a line, a place that
could be returned to, any more than the future, which will not more
exist than the past.  Rather we exist and live and die in a single
present in this cosmos.  There may be other cosmi, in which we exist
or don't exist, if Hugh Everett is proved correct, in which case we
live in a spectrum of different universes, which may or may not pass
information between them at quantum scales.  Just as there may be
other cosmi that are independent of our own branching multiverse.  But
in every scenario there is only the present, the journey, and
complexity and order and change, which is life, or the heat death
which is the lack of change which may be the fate at some unimaginably
distant time in the future after the stars have winked out, and
everything is spread out so far apart of everything else that
interaction and change are impossible.
