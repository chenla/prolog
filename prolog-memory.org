* Introduction


Memory takes many forms, but we will break it down into:

  - Genetic
  - Internal (Human)
    - short, medium, long term
    - muscle memory
  - External
    - Human (group)
    - Animal (domesticated animals)
    - Analog Media (clay, stone, paper)
    - Digital (binary electronic)

Time

  - immediate
  - cyclical (day/night, seasonal, yearly etc)
  - generational
  - institutional (individuals can't remember long term,
    institutions do that for us)

#+begin_quote
Seven generation stewardship is a concept that urges the
current generation of humans to live and work for the
benefit of the seventh generation into the future.[citation
needed] It originated[citation needed] with the Iroquois -
Great Law of the Iroquois - which holds appropriate to think
seven generations ahead (about 140 years into the future)
and decide whether the decisions they make today would
benefit their children seven generations into the future. It
is frequently associated with the modern, popular concept of
environmental stewardship or 'sustainability' but it is much
broader in context (see the quotation below relative to "in
ALL your deliberations ...".
