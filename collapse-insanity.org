* Introduction





* Year Zero Man

Mao, Pol Pot, Stalin etc.

They all have a grand vision for a Utopian Society, when it doesn't
work they realise that people don't change much after they reach a
certain age.  So instead of gradually working towards the Utopia step
by step over multiple generations they decide to take a short-cut and
outright murder everyone that isn't able to change and start with a
clean slate -- year zero.
