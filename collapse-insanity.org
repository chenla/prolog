* Introduction

Man has a proclivity to occasionally go collectively insane and do
monsterous things.

We are primarily interested in the damage caused by these bouts of
suicidal predilections and how it can be cauterized and then minimize
the damage and then help rebuild after people have come to their
senses.

The lesser damage we will call /loss/, and the greater damage, that
may or may not contribute to a /collapse/.  Local collapses can cascade
the cause chain reactions that result in systemic collapses that can
lead to major die-offs and prolonged dark ages.

Loss can be as small as a church or town book burning party, or as
large as the loss of enormous amounts of knowledge in events such as
the fires that destroyed the Library of Alexandria, that resulted in
the losso  of a significant portion of mankind's recorded knowledge
and memory.

It is hoped that by conducting this research, we can begin to
accumulate a number of tests, that recognize danger signs when they
occur before they get out of hand and become dangerous.  This is
certainly no final solution to the problem -- we are too stupid to
entirely fix this in ourselves.  It is the dark part of our nature
that we need to accept as a weakness but never give in to if there is
any way possible.  It is hoped that over the next 20-50,000 years we
will have made real progress in breeding this darkness out of us, or
at least made it more managable.  There is hope.  The world is far
more a peace and mankind is not as much a wild pack of murderous
bastards that we were even a few hundred years ago.  Who knows,
perhap's when the clock of the Long Now chimes it's ten thousandth
year, mankind will have found a way to at least coexist with our
fellow humans without all the blind hatred, ignorance, intolerance and
violence that has so marked our species history to date.

* Year Zero Man

Mao, Pol Pot, Stalin etc.

They all have a grand vision for a Utopian Society, when it doesn't
work they realise that people don't change much after they reach a
certain age.  So instead of gradually working towards the Utopia step
by step over multiple generations they decide to take a short-cut and
outright murder everyone that isn't able to change and start with a
clean slate -- year zero.
