* Discuss

There aren't really any books dedicated to holons -- even
Ghost just has a chapter.

But to make this work we will need to pull an alexander and
build up a case for holons through nature 

Talk of how holons fit into both englebart & alexander's work

-- 

Janus keeps bugging me -- janus is a door god, representing
both the dual nature of things, but more importantly Janus
represents a phase transition -- the transition from one
state to another.  This is something that I always liked
about Japan -- they understand doorways as portals

But dual natures are binary -- either one or the other.
There is no transition -- the cat is alive or dead, there is
no overlap between the two states

When I was young, at a family gathering, I overheard my
mother once asking out loud "when does route one north
become route one south?"  and then came the palm slap moment
and she realised what she had said.  That moment stuck in my
head -- because I kept wondering where the transition was
between binary states.  Where is the crossover between part
and whole.  Because it's not so much a transition -- it's
both existing at the same time -- that is the transition,
when there is no one or the other -- simply a probability
cloud with all causal outcomes having equal weight until it
is observed then you get a phase change.  My had mother
glimpsed something that was there, but could not be observed
or even quantified.

So perhaps Janus is appropriate -- Janus does not have two
faces, he has all faces, but unlike the Roman depictions,
you can only ever observe one at anyone one time. And this
is where the concept of a holon starts to wear a bit thin
and require a different concept; what I am calling a /fnord/.

* Holons

When we started we defined a simple model where everything
could be reduced to /assertions/ and /messages/.  We have
now replaced the assertion with the concept of the /fnord/.
In the same way, we need a more useful concept for a message
than a collection of assertions.

A holon is a philosophical concept that was coined by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Koestler][Arthur
Koestler]], in his 1967 book [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghost_in_the_Machine][The Ghost in the Machine]].

#+begin_quote
A holon is a system (or phenomenon) that is an evolving
self-organizing dissipative structure, composed of other
holons, whose structures exist at a balance point between
chaos and order. It is sometimes discussed in the context of
self-organizing holarchic open systems (or, SOHO systems). A
holon is maintained by the throughput of matter–energy and
information–entropy connected to other holons and is
simultaneously a whole in and itself at the same time being
nested within another holon and so is a part of something
much larger than itself. Holons range in size from the
smallest subatomic particles and strings, all the way up to
the multiverse, comprising many universes. Individual
humans, their societies and their cultures are intermediate
level holons, created by the interaction of forces working
upon us both top-down and bottom-up. On a non-physical
level, words, ideas, sounds, emotions—everything that can be
identified—is simultaneously part of something, and can be
viewed as having parts of its own, similar to sign in regard
of semiotics. In 2013 Australian academic JT Velikovsky
proposed the holon as the structure of the meme, the unit of
culture, synthesizing the major theories on memes of Richard
Dawkins, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, E. O. Wilson, Frederick
Turner and Arthur Koestler. Defined in this way, holons are
related to the concept of autopoiesis, especially as it was
developed in the application of Stafford Beer to
second-order cybernetics and the viable system model, but
also Niklas Luhmann in his social systems theory.

#+end_quote

Essentially everything is a /holon/ -- which can be seen in
one context as a self-contained whole, and from another
perspective as a part of a larger whole.

The message then is a holon and the holon becomes our atomic
unit.  A message is made up of one or more assertions,
statements or facts.  An assertion is not a message, but
must be encoded in a message.  An assertion that is made,
stored or sent and then eventually recieved or read is a
message.  An assertion can be encoded in an infinite number
of messages.


#+begin_quote
There were once two Swiss watchmakers names Bios and Mekhos,
who made very fine and expensive watches.  There names may
sound a little strange, but their fathers had a smattering
of Greek and were fond of riddles.  Although their watches
were in equal demand, Bios propspered, while Mekhos just
struggled along; in the end he had to close his shop and
take a job as a mechanic with Bios.  The people in the town
argued for a long time over the reasons for this development
and each had a different theory to offer, until the true
explanation leaked out and proved to be both simple and
surprising.

The watches they made consisted of about one thousand parts
each, but the two rivals had used different methods to put
them together.  Mekhos had assembled his watches bit by bit
-- rather like making a mosaic floor out of small coloured
stones.  Thus each time when he was disturbed in his work
and had to put down a partly assembled watch, it fell to
pieces and he had to start again from scratch.

Bios, on the other hand, had designed a method of making
watches by constructing, for a start, sub-assemblies of
about ten components, each of which held together as a an
independent unit.  Ten of these sub-assemblies could then be
fitted together into a sub-system of a higher order; and ten
of these sub-systems constituted a whole watch.  This method
proved to have two immense advantages.

In the first place, each time there was an interruption or a
disturbance, and Bios had to put down, or even drop, the
watch he was working on, it did not decompose into its
elementary bits; instead of starting all over again, he
merely had to reassemble that particular sub-assembly on
which he was working at the time; so that at worst (if the
disturbance cam when he had nearly finished the sub-assembly
in hand) he had to repeat nine assumbling operations, and at
best none at all.  Now it is easy to show mathematically
that if a watch consists of a thousand bits, and if some
disturbance occurs on an average of once in every hundred
assembling operations -- then Mekhos will take four thousand
times longer to assemble a watch than Bios.  Instead of a
single day it will take him eleven years.  And of for
mechanical bits, we substitute amino scids, protien
molecules, organelles, and so on, the ration between the
time-scales becomes astronomical; some calculations indicate
that the whole lifetime of the earth would be insufficient
for producing even an amoeba -- unless he becomes converted
to Bios' mthod and proceeds hierarchically, from simple
sub-assemblies to more complex ones.

#+begin_quote
The first universal characteristic of hierarchies is the
relativity, and indeed ambiguity, of the terms 'part' and
whole' when applied to any of the sub-assemblies.  Again it
is the very obviousness of this feature which makes us
overlook its implications.  A 'part', as we generally use
the word, means something fragmentary and incomplete, which
by itself would have no legitimate existence.  On the other
hand, a 'whole' is considered as something complete in
itself which needs no further explanation.  But /'wholes'
and 'parts' in this absolute sensejust do not exist
anywhere/, either in the domain of living organisms or of
social organizations.  What we find are intermediary
structures on a series of levels in an ascending order of
complexity: sub-wholes which display, according to the way
you look at them, some of the characteristics commonly
attributed to parts.

-- Ghost in the Machine pg.48
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
The members of a hierarchy, like the Roman god Janus, all
have two faces looking in opposite directions: the face
turned towards the subordinate levels is that of a
self-contained whole; the face turned upward towards
towards the apex, that of a dependent part.  One is the face
of the master, the other the face of the servant.  This
'/Janus effect/' is a fundamental characteristic of
sub-wholes in all types of hierarchies.

-- Ghost in the Machine pg 48.
#+end_quote


#+begin_quote
But there is no satisfactory word in our vocabulary to refer
to these Janus-faced entities: to talk of sub-wholes (or
sub-assemblies, sub-structures, sub-skills, sub-systems) us
awkward and tedious.  It seem preferable to coin a new term
to designate these nodes on the hierarchic tree which behave
partly as wholes or wholly as parts, according to the way
you look at them.  The term I would propose is 'holon', from
the Greek /holos/ = whole, with the suffix /on/ which, as in
prot/on/ or neutr/on/, suggests a particle or part.

-- Ghost in the Machine pg 48.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
...it is essential for the stability and efficient
functioning of the body social that each of its
sub-divisions should operate as an autonomous, self-reliant
unit which, though subject to control from above, must have
a degree of independence and take routine contingencies in
its stride, without asking higher authority for
instructions.  Otherwuse the communication channels would
become overloaded, the whole system clogged up, the higher
echelons would be kept occupied with petter detail and
unable to concentrate on more important factors.

-- Ghost in the Machine pg 55.
#+end_quote


#+begin_quote
No man is an island he is a holon. A Janus-faced entity who,
looking inward, sees himself as a self-contained unique
whole, looking outward as a dependent part. His
/self-assertive tendency/ is the dynamic manifestation of
his unique /wholeness./, his autonomy and independence as a
holon. Its equally universal antagonist, the /integrative
tendency/, expresses his dependence on the larger whole to
which he belongs: his '/part-ness/'.  The polarity of these
two tendencies, or potentials, is one of the /leitmotivs/ of
the present theory.  Empirically, it can be traced in all
phenomena of life; theoretically, it is derived from the
part-whole dichotomy inherent in the concept of the
multi-layered hierarchy.... For the time being let me repeat
that the /self-assertive tendency is the dynamic expression
of the holon's wholeness, the integrative tendancy, the
dynamic expression of it's partness."

-- Ghost in the Machine pg 56.

#+begin_quote
A Holon is a node in a Holarchy. A Holon looks up for what
it needs to cooperate with and integrate with. It looks
sideways for what it needs to compete with. It looks down
for what it wants to command. Each holon can not be fully
explained by or predicted by a study of its parts. It is
something more. A Holon is also part of something bigger
that it is being affected by. But at the same time it has a
high degree of autonomy, it has a life of its own.

* Holarchies




* Four Types of Holarchies

#+begin_quote
Well, if you look at the variuous "new paradign"
theorists--from holists to ecofeminists to deep ecologists
to systems thinkers--you find that all of them are offering
various types of holarchies, of hierarchies.  Eaven the
anti-hierarchy ecophilosophers offer their own hierarchy,
which is usually something like: atoms are parts of
molecules which are parts of cells, which are parts
individual organisms, which are parts of families, which are
parsts of cultures, which are parts of the total biosphere.
That is their defining hierarchy, their defining holarchy,
and except for some confusion about what "biosphere" means,
that is a fairly accurate holarchy.

And likewise, orthodox researchers offer their own
hierarchies.  We find hierarchies in moral development, in
ego development, in cognitive development, in self needs, in
defense mechanisms, and so on.  And these, too, see to be
largely accurate.  We also find developmental holarchies in
everything from Marxism to strucuralism to linguistics to
computer programming--it's simply endless.

In other words, whether it's realized or not, most of the
maps of the world that have been offered are in fact
holarchical, for the simple reason that holarchies are
impossible to avoid (because holons are impossible to
avoid).  We have literally hundreds and hundreds of these
holoarchical maps from around the world--East and West,
North and South, ancient and modern--many of these maps
included the mapmaker as well.

-- [[bib:wilbur:1996wilbur][A Brief History of Everything]] p72 | Ken Wilbur
#+end_quote


But then Wilbur goes further by comparing as many different
holarchies as he could to see if they all fit together.

#+begin_quote
So at one point I simply started making lists all of these
holarchical maps--conventional and new age, Eastern and
Western, premodern and postmodern--everything from systems
theory to the Great Chain of Being, from the Buddhist
vijnanas to Piaget, Marx, Kholberg, and the Vedantic koshas,
Loevinger, Maslow, Linski, Kabbalah, and so on.  I had
literally hundreds of thesethigs, these maps, spread out on
legal pads all over the floor.

At first I thought these maps were all referring to the same
territory, so to speak.  I thought they were all different
versions of an essentially similar holarchy.  There were
just too many similarities and overlaps in all of them.  So
by comparing and contrasting them all, I thought I might be
able to find the single abd basc holarchy that they were all
trying to represent in their own ways.

The more I tried this, the more it became obvious that it
wouldn't work.  These various holarchies had some undeniable
similarities, but they differed in certain profound ways,
and the exact nature of these differences was not obvious at
all.  And most confusing of all, in some of these
holorchical maps, the holons got /bigger/ as development
progressed, and in others, they became /smaller/ (I didn't
yet understand that evolution produces greater depth, less
span).  It was a real mess, and at several points I decided
to just chuck it, forget it, because nothing was coming of
this research.

But the more I looked at these various holarchies, the more
it dawned on me that there were actually /four very
different types/ of holarchies, four very different types of
holistic sequences.  As you say, I don't think this had been
spotted before--perhaps because it was so stupidly simple;
at any event it was news to me.  But once I put all of these
holarchies into these four groups--they instantly fell into
place at that point--then it was very obvious that each
holarchy in each group was indeed dealing with the same
territory, but overall had four different territories, so to
speak.

#+CAPTION: Wilbur's Four Holarchy Quadrants
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500px
[[./img/holon/wilber--four-quadrants.png]]

#+begin_quote
So the question then became, how did these four types of
holarchies relate to each other?  They couldn't just be
radically different holistic sequences.  They had to touch
each other somehow.

Eventually it dawned on me that these four quadrants have an
incredibly simple foundation.  These four types of
holarchies are actually dealing with the /inside/ and
/outside/ of a holon, in both its /individual/ and
/collective/ forms--and that gives us four quadrants.

Inside and outside, singular and plural--some of the
simplest distinctions we can make, and these very simple
features, which are present in all holons, generate these
generate these very simple features, which are present in
all holons, generate these four quadrants, or so I
maintain.  All four of these holarchies are dealing with
real aspects of real holons--which is why these four types
of holarchies keep aggressively and insistently showing up
on the various maps around the world.....

The four quadrants are the /interior/ and /exterior/ of the
/individual/ and the /collective/....

We can start with the individual holon, in both its interior
and exterior aspects.  In  other words, with the Upper Left
quadrant and the Upper Right quadrant.  Figure 5-3 is a
little more detailed map of these two quadrants.


   #+CAPTION: figure 5-3

   | *UPPER LEFT*          | *UPPER RIGHT*                           |

   | irritability          | cells (genetic)                         |
   | rudimentary sensation | metabolic organisms (e.g. coelenterata) |
   | perception            | neuronal organisms (e.g. annelids)      |
   | perception/impulse    | neural cord (fish/amphibians)           |
   | impulse/emotion       | brain stem (reptiles)                   |
   | emotion/image         | limbic system (paleomammals)            |
   | symbols               | neocortex (primates)                    |
   | concepts              | complex neocortex (humans)              |
 
If you look at the Right Hand column first, you can see the
typical holarchy presented in any standard biology
textbook.  Each level transcends and includes its
predecessor.  Each level includes the basics of the previous
level and then adds its own distincting and defining
characteristics, it's own emergents.  Each of these follow
the twenty tenents and so on.

But notice that these are all exterior descriptions--it's
what these holons look like from the outside, in an
objective and empirical manner.  Thus, in a scientific text,
you will find the limbic system, for example, described in
detail--its components, its biochemistry, when and how it
evolved, how it relates to other parts of the organism, and
so on.  And you will probably find it mentioned that the
limbic system is the home of very certain very fundemental
/emotions/, certain basic types of sex and aggression and
fear and desire, whetherthat limbic system appears in horses
or humans or apes.

But if those emotions, of course, you will not find much
dfescription, because emotions pertain to the /interior
experience/ of the limbic system.  And /objective/
scientific descriptions are not much interested in that
interior consciousness, because that interior space cannot
be accessed in an objective, empirical fashion.  You can
only /feel/ these feelings from within.  When you experience
a sort of primal joy, for example, even if you are a brain
physiologist, you do not say to yourself, Waw, what a limbic
dat.  Rather, you describe these feelings in intimate,
personal, emortional terms, /subjective/ terms: I feel
wonderful, it's great to be alive, or whatnot.

So in the Left Hand column, you can see a list of some of
the basic types of /subjective/ or /interior awareness/ that
go with these variopus /objective/ or /exterior forms/
listed in the Right Column.  "Irritability"--the capacity to
actively respond to environmental stimuli--begins with
cells.  Sensations emerge with neuronal organisms, and
perceptions emerge with the neural cord.  Impulses emerge
with a brain stem, and basic emotions with a limbic system.
And so on.

This is also a holarchy, but a subjective or interior
holarchy.  Each level also transcends and includes it[s]
predecessor, each follows the twenty tenents, and so on.
And this Left Hand holarchy, like the Right Hand, is based
on extensive evidence already available, which we can
discuss if you want.

But the main point is that this Left Hand dimension refers
to the inside, to the /interior depth/ that is
/conciousness/ itself.

.... The Left Hand is what the holon looks like from within;
the Right Hand is what the same holon looks like from
without.  Interior and exterior.  Consciousness and form.
Subjective and objective.

.... We don't have to agree with the exact placement of
everything in figure 5-3, but most people would agree that
/something/ like that is occurring.

#+CAPTION: Details of Four Holarchy Quadrants
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500px
[[./img/holon/wilber--quadrant-details.png]]


Now about the lower half, the collective.....

#+begin_quote
... Individual holons exist exist /only in compunities/ of
simular-depth holons.  So we beed to go through both of the
columns in figure 5-3 and find the types of /communal/
holons that are always associated with the /individual/
holons.

-- [[bib:wilbur:1996wilbur][A Brief History of Everything]] p77- | Ken Wilbur
#+end_quote

And the Lower Left and Lower Right are "cultural" and
"social" holarchies.

#+begin_quote
... "cultural" refers to all of the /interior/ meanings and
values and identities that we share with those of similar
communities, whether it is a tribal community or a national
community or a world community.  And "social" refers to all
of the exterior, material, institutional /forms/ of the
community, from its techno-economic base to its
architectural styles to its written codes to its population
size, to name a few.

So in a very general sense, "cultural" refers to the shared
collective /worldview/ and "social" refers to the /material
base/ of that worldview.  (Of course, right now I'm just
talking about how these appear in human holons; we'll
discuss nonhuman in a moment.)  Social means any objective,
concrete, material components, and especially the
techno-economic base, so you see these listed as foraging,
horticultural, agrarian, industriall; and the geopolitical
structures of villages, states, world federation, and so
on.  These are all examples of the exterior forms of the
collective, as you can see in figure 5-2.

-- [[bib:wilbur:1996wilbur][A Brief History of Everything]] p77-78 | Ken Wilbur
#+end_quote

Now non-human holons....


#+begin_quote
If consciousness is depth, and depth goes all the way down,
then shared depth or common depth also goes all the way
down--culture goes all the way down... In other words, if
holons share outsides, they share insides....

By the culture or worldspace of holons, I simply mean a
shared space of what they /can/ respond to: quarks do not
respond to all stimuli in the environment, because they
/register/ a very narrow range of what will have meaning to
them, what will /affect/ them.  Quarks (and all holons)
respond only to that which /fits their worldspace/:
everything else is a foreign language, and they are
outsiders.  The study of what holons /can/ respond to is the
study of shared worldspaces.  It's the common world that all
holons of a similar depth will respond to.  That is their
shared culture.

[for example] Nonhuman cultures can be very sophisticated.
Wolves, for example, share an emotional worldspace.  They
possess a limbic system, the interior correlate of which is
certain basic emotions.  And thus a wolf orients itself and
its fellow wolves to the world through the use of these
basic emotional cognitions--not just reptilian and
sensorimotor, but affective.  They can hunt and coordinate
in packs through a very sophisticated emotional signal
systems.  They share this emotional worldspace.

Yet anything /outside/ that worldspace is /not registered//
I mean you can read /Hamlet/ to them, but no luck.  What you
are, with that book, is basically dinner plus a few things
that will have to be spat out.

The point is that a holon responds, and /can respon/ only to
those stimuli that fall within its worldspace, its
worldview.  Everything else is nonexistent....

Same with humans.  By the time evolution reaches the
neocortex, or the complex triune brain, with its interior
correlates of images and symbols and concepts, these basic
worldspaces have become articulated into rather
sophisticated cognitive structures.  These worldspaces
/incorporate/ the basic componments of the previous
world-spaces-- such as cellular irritability amd reptilian
instincts and paleo-mammalian emotionss--but they /add/ new
components that articulate or unfold new worldviews.

Remember, the Kosmos looks diferent at each of these stages
because the Kosmos /is/ different at each of these stages.
At each of thes stages, the Kosmos looks at itself with new
eyes, and thus brings forth new worlds not previously
existing.

These cultural worldspaces are listed on Lower Left.  And
you an see they they evolve from phsycical and vegetative
and reptiliand ("uroboric"--of the serpent) and
limbic-emotional ("typhonic"), into more specifically
hominid and then human forms: archaic, magic, mythic,
rational, centauric (or existential), and possible higher
stages yet to come.

These worldview are correlated with the /exterior/ forms of
the /social structures/ that support each of those
worldviews and the individuals within them--again, all the
way down.  For example, from the prokaryotic Gaia system to
societies with a division of labor (in neural organisms) to
groups/families of paleomammals to the more human forms of:
/foraging/ tribes to /horticultural/ villages to /agrariam/
empires to /industrial/ states to /informational/ global
federation.  Which is the list to date, as reconstructed
from available evidence.  These are all listed on the Lower
Right.

Q: And these four quadrants are related to each other in
exactly what fashion?

KW: In any fasion you want.  Just don't reduce them one to
another.  I have some specific thoughts on this, but right
now I don't want to push my own theory in this regard.  I
will settle for the /orienting generalization/ that we
simply cannot reduce these quadrants to each other without
profound distortions and violent ruptures.  So let us grant
each of them a certain integrity, I think.  Let's just say
they interrelate, or they interact, or they each have
correlates in the others.  That's plenty to work with.  When
we talk about the different truths in each quadrant, I think
you'll see what I mean.
