   McGonigal, Slate

In one sense, your brain is right, the future you is not
you, it will be a very different person from you today, all
but a stranger who will have share some fuzzy and often just
plain wrong memories with you.

The famous pipe. How people reproached me for it! And yet,
could you stuff my pipe? No, it's just a representation, is
it not? So if I had written on my picture 'This is a pipe',
I'd have been lying!

#+begin_quote
The expression first appeared in print in a paper that
Alfred Korzybski gave at a meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science in New Orleans,
Louisiana in 1931:[1] In Science and Sanity, Korzybski
acknowledges his debt to mathematician Eric Temple Bell,
whose epigram "the map is not the thing mapped" was
published in Numerology.[fn:1]

    A map is not the territory it represents, but, if
    correct, it has a similar structure to the territory,
    which accounts for its usefulness.

    — Alfred Korzybski, Science and Sanity (1933, p. 58)[fn:2]

Even in theology, it could be asked if the concept of a
single all powerful God, an infinite being, is a map or
territory?

Can a territory be sentient?  Can sentience, and
intelligence be possible unless it can separate itself from
the larger world it exists in?  Lesser Gods in human
mythologies don't have this same problem, there are many of
them, and they are acting on the world, therefore they exist
separate from the world.  But an all knowing, all seeing,
god is only possible if it is as complete a map of the
territory as the territory and so, is pefectly useless
and powerless.

This same argument can be used when posulating a god-like
artificial intelligence, it places a very real barrier
between the universe any any beings who inhabit it.


* Seven generation sustainability

#+begin_quote
Seven generation stewardship is a concept that urges the
current generation of humans to live and work for the
benefit of the seventh generation into the future.[citation
needed] It originated[citation needed] with the Iroquois -
Great Law of the Iroquois - which holds appropriate to think
seven generations ahead (about 140 years into the future)
and decide whether the decisions they make today would
benefit their children seven generations into the future. It
is frequently associated with the modern, popular concept of
environmental stewardship or 'sustainability' but it is much
broader in context (see the quotation below relative to "in
ALL your deliberations ...".
