abstract = {According to predictive processing, minds relentlessly aim at a single goal: prediction error minimization. Prediction error minimization is said to explain everything the mind does, from perception to cognition to action. Here I focus on action. ‘Active inference’ is the standard approach to action in predictive processing. According to active inference, as it has been developed by Friston and collaborators, action ensues when proprioceptive predictions generate prediction error at the motor periphery, and classical reflex arcs engage to quash the error. I raise a series of problems for active inference. I then offer an alternative approach on which action prevents error (APE), rather than quash it. I argue that the action prevents error approach solves all the problems raised for active inference. In addition, I show how the alternative approach can be independently motivated by further commitments of predictive processing and that it is compatible with other prominent approaches to sensorimotor psychology, such as optimal feedback control.},

The free-energy principle is a system-theoretic framework for understanding living self-organizing systems and how they relate to their environments. I will first sketch the main philosophical positions in the literature: a rationalist Helmholtzian interpretation (Hohwy 2013; Clark 2013), a cybernetic interpretation (Seth 2015) and the enactive affordance-based interpretation (Bruineberg and Rietveld 2014; Bruineberg et al. forthcoming) and will then show how agency and intentionality are construed differently on these different philosophical interpretations. I will then argue that a purely Helmholtzian is limited, in that it can account only account for agency in the context of perceptual inference. The cybernetic account cannot give a full account of action, since purposiveness is accounted for only to the extent that it pertains to the control of homeostatic essential variables. I will then argue that the enactive affordance-based account attempts to provide broader account of purposive action without presupposing goals and intentions coming from outside of the theory. In the second part of the paper, I will discuss how each of these three interpretations conceives of the sense agency and intentionality in different ways.},

@incollection{vandecruys:2017affective,
abstract = {Although affective value is fundamental in explanations of behavior, it is still a somewhat alien concept in cognitive science. It implies a normativity or directionality that mere information processing models cannot seem to provide. In this paper we trace how affective value can emerge from information processing in the brain, as described by predictive processing. We explain the grounding of predictive processing in homeostasis, and articulate the implications this has for the concept of reward and motivation. However, at first sight, this new conceptualization creates a strong tension with conventional ideas on reward and affective experience. We propose this tension can be resolved by realizing that valence, a core component of all emotions, might be the reflection of a specific aspect of predictive information processing, namely the dynamics in prediction errors across time and the expectations we, in turn, form about these dynamics. Specifically, positive affect seems to be caused by positive rates of prediction error reduction, while negative affect is induced by a shift in a state with lower prediction errors to one with higher prediction errors (i.e., a negative rate of error reduction). We also consider how intense emotional episodes might be related to unexpected changes in prediction errors, suggesting that we also build (meta)predictions on error reduction rates. Hence in this account emotions appear as the continuous non-conceptual feedback on evolving —increasing or decreasing—uncertainties relative to our predictions. The upshot of this view is that the various emotions, from “basic” ones to the non-typical ones such as humor, curiosity and aesthetic affects, can be shown to follow a single underlying logic. Our analysis takes several cues from existing emotion theories but deviates from them in revealing ways. The account on offer does not just specify the interactions between emotion and cognition, rather it entails a deep integration of the two.},

@incollection{limanowski:2017attending,
abstract = {Endogenous attention is crucial and beneficial for learning, selecting, and supervising actions. However, deliberately attending to action execution usually comes at the cost of decreased smoothness and slower performance, often severely impairs normal functioning, and in the worst case may result in pathological behavior and experience as in schizophrenic hyperreflexivity. These ambiguous modulatory effects of self-directed attention have been examined on phenomenological, computational, and implementational levels of description—a recent formalization within an active inference framework aims to accommodate all of these aspects. Here, I examine the active inference account of motor control as enabled by attentional modulation based on expected precisions of prediction errors in a brain’s hierarchical generative model of the environment. The implications of active inference fit well with a range of empirical results, they resonate well with ideomotor accounts of motor control, and they also tentatively reflect many insights from phenomenological analysis of the “lived body”. Thereby a particular strength of active inference is its hierarchical account of motor control in terms of adaptive behavior driven by the imperative to maintain the organism’s states within unsurprising boundaries. Phenomena ranging from the reflex arc to intentional, goal-directed action and the experience of oneself as an embodied agent are are thus proposed to rely on the same mechanisms operating universally throughout the brain’s hierarchical generative model. However, while the explanation of movement production and sensory attenuation in terms of low-level attentional modulation is quite elegant on the active inference view, there are some questions left open by its extension to higher levels of action control and the accompanying phenomenology of for example volition, effort, or agency. I suggest that conceptual guidance from recent accounts of phenomenal self- and world-modeling may help develop active inference into an interdisciplinary framework for investigating embodied agentive self-experience.},

abstract = {Whilst much has been said about the implications of predictive processing for our scientific understanding of cognition, there has been comparatively little discussion of how this new paradigm fits with our everyday understanding of the mind, i.e. folk psychology. This paper aims to assess the relationship between folk psychology and predictive processing, which will first require making a distinction between two ways of understanding folk psychology: as propositional attitude psychology and as a broader folk psychological discourse. It will be argued that folk psychology in this broader sense is compatible with predictive processing, despite the fact that there is an apparent incompatibility between predictive processing and a literalist interpretation of propositional attitude psychology. The distinction between these two kinds of folk psychology allows us to accept that our scientific usage of folk concepts requires revision, whilst rejecting the suggestion that we should eliminate folk psychology entirely. In section 1 I will introduce predictive processing, giving a quick summary of the framework that focuses on the details most relevant for my comparison with folk psychology. I will also introduce folk psychology and define the distinction between propositional attitude psychology and folk psychological discourse. In section 2 I will consider the relationship between predictive processing and propositional attitude psychology, and in section 3 I will consider the relationship between predictive processing and folk psychological discourse. Finally, in section 4 I will argue that the distinction between propositional attitude psychology and folk psychological discourse makes space for us to revise our scientific usage of folk psychological concepts without thereby eliminating folk psychology altogether.},

The tension is traced to the importance, in free energy formulations, of a conception of mind and agency that depends upon the presence of a ‘Markov blanket’ Andrey Markov demarcating the agent from the surrounding world. In what follows I show that the Markov blanket considerations do not, in fact, lead to the kinds of tension that Howhy depicts. On the contrary, they actively favour the EEE story. This is because the Markov property, as exemplified in biological agents, picks out neither a unique nor a stationary boundary. It is this multiplicity and mutability– rather than the absence of agent-environment boundaries as such - that EEE cognition celebrates.},

The argument consists in first defending a minimal conception of inference based on Gilbert Harman’s account (Harman 1973), and then arguing that Helmholtzian computational models of perceptual inference such as those proposed in Hinton and Sejnowski 1983, Hinton et al. 1995, and Friston 2005 implement the type of process Harman describes. In the course of the argument, I consider constraints on inference based on the idea that inference is a deliberate action (Boghossian 2014, Broome 2014, Wright 2014), and on the idea that inferences depend on the syntactic structure of representations (Mandelbaum 2016). I argue that inference is a personal-level but sometimes unconscious process that cannot in general be distinguished from association on the basis of the structures of the representations over which it’s defined. I also critique the argument against representationalist interpretations of Helmholtzian theories in Orlandi 2015, and argue against the view that perceptual inference is encapsulated in a module.},

What is the relative contribution of each, and how exactly do they relate? In order to answer this question, we compare the way in which these two modeling frameworks address different levels of analysis within Marr’s tripartite hierarchy for explanation in cognitive science. Whereas BRA answers questions at the computational level only, many HPC-theorists answer questions at the computational, algorithmic, and implementational levels simultaneously. Given that all three levels of analysis need to be addressed in order to explain a behavioral or cognitive phenomenon, HPC seems to deliver more complete explanations. Nevertheless, BRA is well-suited for providing a solution to the dark room problem, a major theoretical obstacle for HPC. A combination of the two approaches also combines the benefits of an embodied-externalistic approach to resolving the dark room problem with the idea of a persisting evidentiary border beyond which matters are out of cognitive reach. For this reason, the development of explanations spanning all three Marrian levels within the general Bayesian approach will require combining the BRA and HPC modeling frameworks.},

@incollection{dolega:2017moderate,
abstract = {In this paper I discuss two leading positions regarding the representational commitments of the predictive processing approach to cognition. So called conservative predictive processing (cPP) (Clark2015a), claims that the explanatory power of the framework comes from postulating a rich nesting of genuine representational structures which come to serve as a model of the organism’s external and internal milieu (Hohwy2016; Gladziejewski2015a). Radical predictive processing (rPP), on the other hand, postulates that not all elements of the computational architecture should be interpreted as full-blown representations (Clark2015a). Instead, proponents of this approach argue that the relevant computational level descriptions (Marr1982) serve merely as abstract schemata aimed at capturing the dynamics of processes, which are embedded into neural structures by evolutionary selection (Orlandi2013; Orlandi2014; Orlandiforth) and do not depend on manipulating genuine representations (Clark2015b; DowneyThisCollection; BruinebergThisCollection). 
 Surprisingly, both approaches are motivated by the adoption of William Ramsey's representational ‘job description challenge’ (Ramsey2007), according to which appeals to representational posits must be supported by a convincing demonstration of the relevant elements or structures playing a representational role within the functioning of a wider cognitive system. Gładziejewski Paweł Gładziejewski follows Ramsey in order to show that PP’s generative models perform a representational function by acting as detachable, information bearing structures which stand-in for the features of the environment, in order to enable capacities such as action-guidance and error detection. Clark Andy Clark and Orlandi Nico Orlandi, on the other hand, claim that only higher levels of the PP hierarchy exhibit such capacities, while lower (e.g. perceptual) levels should be construed as model-free structures governed by biases acquired through reinforcement learning or phylogenetic development. 
 The main aim of this paper is to evaluate the competing approaches in relation to the underlying computational architecture and show that the disagreement between the two sides of the debate does not cut as deep as it has been presented in the literature. The main reason for this is that both sides agree on how to understand Ramsey’s representational challenge and the functionally distinct notions of representation it introduces. However, an investigation into the roles played by the structures posited by PP reveals that the job description challenge may be insufficient to differentiate the competing views. Although it does not support the radical claim that peripheral layers of PP systems consist in solely non-representational elements, it also poses a serious problem for the conservative side of the debate by inviting ambiguities with regard to the ascription of representational function to more nested structures. Proponents of cPP are tasked with distinguishing internal models targeting external, environmental features from structures functioning as meta-representations modelling the behavior of other parts of the system. I propose that the difference between the competing positions must come down to the question about the content of PP’s internal models. Supporters of rPP are faced with the task of introducing additional conditions which would help distinguish their position from the conservative one. Members of the cPP camp, on the other hand, can secure their interpretation by providing conditions for determining the contents of representational and meta-representational elements. Still, this is not an easy task due to the informational encapsulation of different layers of the system and the unclear conditions for identifying cases of misrepresentation. 
 Because this paper is part of a larger collection beginning with a primer aimed at elucidating the main tenets of PP to an uninitiated audience (WieseMetzingerThisCollection), I will skip a typical introduction to the framework. Instead, I will start by articulating Ramsey's representational job description requirement for non-vacuous ascription of representational function (section 1), followed by a brief presentation of the two competing interpretations of the framework (section 2). Having delineated the available positions, I will move on to evaluate which of the elements posited by PP should be the target for the debate over the framework’s representational status (section 3.1). From there, I will argue that the representational job description challenge does not offer sufficient ground for distinguishing rPP from its conservative counterpart, by showing that it fails to secure a non-representational interpretation of the system’s peripheral layers (section 3.2). This, however, does not mean that cPP cannot be contested, as proponents of this reading must face the opposite problem of functional indeterminacy in models removed from the sensory periphery (sections 3.3). While, in principle, it is possible to resolve these issues by appealing to the contents of such posited representations, in practice this solution faces further difficulties, relating to a lack of clear conditions for content determination (section 3.4). I close the paper with a call for moderation in making claims regarding PP’s representational status, and point to two strategies for solving the problem at the heart of the debate (section 4).},

This assumption of modularity seems to be in tension with recent claims that the mind has a predictive architecture. Predictive approaches propose that both sensory processing and higher-level processing are part of the same Bayesian information-processing hierarchy, with no clear boundary between perception and cognition. Furthermore, it is not clear how any part of the predictive architecture could be functionally independent, given that each level of the hierarchy is influenced by the level above. Both the assumption of continuity across the predictive architecture and the seeming non-isolability of parts of the predictive architecture seem to be at odds with the modular approach.

abstract = {The general question of our paper concerns the relationship between Bayesian models of cognition and predictive processing, and whether predictive processing can provide explanatory insight over and above Bayesian models. Bayesian models have been gaining influence in neuroscience and the cognitive sciences since they are able to predict human behavior with high accuracy. Models based on a Bayesian optimal observer are fitted on behavioral data. A good fit is hence interpreted as human subjects “behaving” in a Bayes’ optimal fashion. However, these models are performance-oriented and do not specify which processes could give rise to the observed behavior. Here, David Marr’s (Marr 1982) levels of analysis can help understand the relationship between performance- and process-oriented models or explanations. Bayesian models are situated at the computational level since they specify what the system (in this case the brain) does and why it does it in this manner. Although Bayesian models can constrain the search space for hypotheses at the algorithmic level, they do not provide a precise solution about how a system realizes the observed behavior. Here predictive processing can shed more light on the underlying principles. Predictive processing provides a unifying functional theory of cognition and can thus i) provide an answer at the algorithmic level by answering how the brain realizes cognition, ii) can aid in the interpretation of neurophysiological findings at the implementational level.},

@incollection{fabry:2017predictive,
abstract = {The ability to acquire new cognitive capacities is the hallmark of the human mind. Emerging predictive processing (PP) accounts promise to offer a unified, mechanistic perspective on the neuro-functional realization of this complex process. The acquisition of any given cognitive capacity can be depicted as a specific stage of the continuous prediction error minimization process. This stage is characterized by distinct functional profiles, unique patterns of neuronal activation in crucial brain areas, and the refinement and flexible adaptation of motor programs to new processing challenges. In this paper, I will suggest that PP is a good conceptual partner for accounts of enculturation. Enculturation is the idea that socio-culturally shaped cognitive processes emerge from an individual’s scaffolded, embodied interaction with its cognitive niche. This structured engagement with specific, socio-culturally developed patterns in the niche transforms the overall cognitive capacities of an individual (Menary 2013; Menary 2015). The process of enculturation is associated with significant changes in the functional and structural properties of the brain. Furthermore, it alters and refines the functional profiles of bodily actions and motor programs. I will argue that PP offers important conceptual tools and theoretical considerations that complement these basic principles of enculturation in a new and original way. The resulting account of the enculturated predictive acquisition of cognitive capacities (EPACC) has the conceptual resources to consider specific cases of cognitive development at multiple levels of explanation. This new perspective on EPACC is a timely contribution to the debate about the philosophical implications of PP. On the one hand, Jakob Hohwy (Hohwy 2013) argues that PP implies an internalistic and neurocentric view of cognition. On his account, the embodiedness of cognitive systems and their flexible interaction with the local environment do not seem to play an important role in accounts of cognitive processes. On the other hand, Andy Clark (Clark 2016) defends the idea that PP is compatible with philosophical positions that emphasize the embodied, embedded, extended, or enacted (4E) dimensions of cognition. In this paper, I will discuss both interpretations of PP and assess their relationship to EPACC. I will challenge the internalistic account of PP on conceptual grounds. At the same time, I will argue that EPACC offers a concrete proposal for the complementarity of PP and enculturation. The overall argument is that the acquisition of new, socio-culturally shaped cognitive capacities is a matter of enculturation. The underlying neuronal and bodily transformation routines can be described in terms of PP. However, if we aim for a full-fledged account of the complexity and fragility of cognitive development, we also need an account of the fine-grained interactions of novices with their structured environment.},

Phenomenologically, they suggest a more fine-grained analysis of the perceptual contents of the specious present, in terms of a hierarchy of nested temporal wholes. Visual perception of static scenes not only contains perceived objects and regions but also spatial gist; similarly, auditory perception of temporal sequences, such as melodies, involves not only perceiving individual notes but also slightly more abstract features (temporal gist), which have longer temporal durations (e.g., emotional character or rhythm). Further investigations into these elusive contents of conscious perception may be facilitated by findings regarding its neural underpinnings. Predictive processing models suggest that sensorimotor areas may influence these contents. [1]

@incollection{downey:2017radical,
abstract = {In this paper I outline and defend a novel approach to conscious perception, which I label “radical sensorimotor enactivism”. The aims of the paper are two-fold: (1) to respond to a common objection to theories like radical sensorimotor enactivism— that they are empirically vacuous— and explain why, because radical sensorimotor enactivism uses (a non-representational version of) predictive processing to operationalize its sub-personal aspects, this objection cannot be levelled at the theory; and, (2) to argue that radical sensorimotor enactivism provides a better empirical account of conscious perception than predictive processing taken as a stand-alone theory. I conclude that radical sensorimotor enactivism provides one with a strong over-arching conceptual framework for the scientific study of conscious perception which clarifies the relation between existing strands of empirical work and provides practical guidance for future research. As such, it is worthy of further development, study, and application in empirical settings.},

@incollection{buccigrasso.2017sleep
abstract = {Sleep and dreaming are important daily phenomena that are receiving growing attention from both the scientific and the philosophical field. The increasingly popular predictive brain framework within cognitive science aims to give a full account of all aspects of cognition. The aim of this paper is to critically assess the theoretical advantages of Predictive Processing (PP, as proposed by Clark 2013, Clark 2016; and Hohwy 2013) in defining sleep and dreaming. After a brief introduction, we overview the state of the art at the intersection between dream research and PP (with particular reference to Hobson and Friston 2012; Hobson et al. 2014). In the following sections we focus on two theoretically promising aspects of the research program. First, we consider the explanations of phenomenal consciousness during sleep (i.e. dreaming) and how it arises from the neural work of the brain. PP provides a good picture of the peculiarity of dreaming but it can’t fully address the problem of how consciousness comes to be in the first place. We propose that Integrated Information Theory (IIT) (Oizumi et al. 2014; Tononi et al. 2016) is a good candidate for this role and we will show its advantages and points of contact with PP. After introducing IIT, we deal with the evolutionary function of sleeping and dreaming. We illustrate that PP fits with contemporary researches on the important adaptive function of sleep and we discuss why IIT can account for sleep mentation (i.e. dreaming) in evolutionary terms (Albantakis et al. 2014). In the final section, we discuss two future avenues for dream research that can fruitfully adopt the perspective offered by PP: (a) the role of bodily predictions in the constitution of the sleeping brain activity and the dreaming experience, and (b) the precise role of the difference stages of sleep (REM (Rapid eye movement), NREM (Non-rapid eye movement)) in the constitution and refinement of the predictive machinery.},

@incollection{gładziejewski:2017evidence,
abstract = {Traditional foundationalist empiricist projects in epistemology postulated that sensory states of the subject are epistemically basic, in that they are capable of conferring justification on mental representations of the world without themselves needing to be (inferentially) justified by any antecedent representational states. This sort of view faces a seemingly hopeless dilemma, whose recognition is usually attributed to Wilfrid Sellars. If we treat sensory states as brute stimulations devoid of intentional content, then it is hard to see how the senses could provide subjects with anything that could possibly feature in justification-conferring relations with representational states. If we treat them as contentful, then in order to justify contentful states, sensory states themselves would presumably need to be justified by other representational states; but if this is so, they are not able to play a properly foundational epistemic role. In the article, I use the Predictive Processing (PP) view of perception in order to sketch a possible resolution of the Sellarsian dilemma. I draw on PP in order to show how sensory states could actually serve a normative role that is recognizably similar to the one envisioned by traditional empiricists. To do this, I first distinguish representational from non-representational posits of PP and subsequently focus on the role that PP ascribes to sensory or “driving” signal. In particular, I argue that (1) the driving signal plays a role of a non-representational, contentless detector; at the same time, (2) it serves as an “impartial” or “theory-neutral” tribunal against which contentful internal models are actively tested and updated. Drawing on Anil Gupta’s work, I discuss the epistemic involvement of the sensory signal in perceptual inference and show how the signal provides conditional justification (i.e. justification that is conditional on the justification or rationality of prior knowledge) to perceptual hypotheses. Then I discuss the role the sensory signal plays in perceptual learning. I employ the notion of “epistemic convergence” to sketch out how the sensory signal could provide perceivers with unconditional justification (i.e. one that is not relativized to the justification of prior knowledge). If this approach is right, the Sellarsian dilemma seems to be averted. We can see how the senses can be at the same time silent (i.e. contentless) and capable of playing a sort of foundational epistemic role.},

@incollection{pliushch:2017overtone,
abstract = {In this paper I will argue for what I call an ‘overtone model of self-deception’. The analogy to overtones (higher-order frequencies of a tone) is as follows: a self-deceiver’s optimal degree of instability (the term is borrowed from Friston et al. 2012, and applied to self-deception) is elevated so that constant exploration (of a certain number of hypotheses) is pursued instead of disambiguation in favor of a certain hypothesis. These hypotheses are explored in parallel (for similar ideas with respect to higher-order cognition in general see Pezzulo and Cisek 2016, and Metzinger 2017) and are like overtones of the currently active self-deceptive hypothesis (the base frequency) so that what we as self-deceivers, as well as observers, perceive as one tone (self-deception) is actually a fusion of different frequencies. The term ‘fusion’ is relevant because the phenomenology of the self-deceiver is co-determined by overtones.},

@incollection{metzinger:2017problem,
abstract = {In mental action there is no motor output to be controlled and no sensory input vector that could be manipulated by bodily movement. It is therefore unclear whether this specific target phenomenon can be accommodated under the predictive processing framework at all, or if the concept of “active inference” can be adapted to this highly relevant explanatory domain. This contribution puts the phenomenon of mental action into explicit focus by introducing a set of novel conceptual instruments and developing a first positive model, focussing on epistemic mental actions and epistemic self-control. Action initiation is a functionally adequate form of self-deception; mental actions are a specific form of predictive control of effective connectivity, accompanied and possibly even functionally mediated by a conscious “epistemic agent model”. The overall process is aimed at increasing the epistemic value of pre-existing states in the conscious self-model, without causally looping through sensory sheets or using the non-neural body as an instrument for active inference.},

@incollection{sims:2017problems,
abstract = {There is a disagreement over the scope of explanation for predictive processing. While some proponents think that it is best motivated from—and indeed comprises an explanation of—biological self-organization, others maintain that it should only be a theory of neurocognitive function, or even just of some limited domain of neurocognitive function. Something that these theorists share is an interest in addressing the dark-room problem: at its most naïve, if action is driven by the minimization of surprise then why don’t cognitive creatures act to minimize stimuli in general? The dark-room problem is in fact best conceived as a cluster of related concerns, rather than as a single argument against action-oriented predictive processing. These have to do with: i) whether PP (predictive processing) has any substantive empirical content when it is pitched in very general domains; ii) whether a specification can be given of the environmental niche that action moves the organism to occupy, and which is not the dark room; and iii) whether an adequate account can be given within this specification of exploratory and exploitative behaviours. There are interesting conceptual relations between the dark-room problem and the scope dispute. As the putative scope of predictive processing gets wider (culminating in the free energy principle), the resources that are available for answering the concerns about niche-specification become very rich. But increasingly puzzling problems arise as to the implementation of surprise-minimisation within non-paradigmatically cognitive biological systems. On the other hand, under more restrictive construals of the scope of predictive processing, there are new difficulties standing in the way of niche-specification, and new questions about the interface between surprise-minimisation and model-free cognition undermine the promise of predictive processing as a unifier of theories of neurocognitive function in subordinate domains. In this paper I make explicit the dialectic between proponents and critics in order to show how the two problems are related.},

@incollection{wiesemetzinger.2017vanilla
abstract = {The goal of this short chapter, aimed at philosophers, is to provide an overview and brief explanation of some central concepts involved in predictive processing (PP). Even those who consider themselves experts on the topic may find it helpful to see how the central terms are used in this collection. To keep things simple, we will first informally define a set of features important to predictive processing, supplemented by some short explanations and an alphabetic glossary. The features described here are not shared in all PP accounts. Some may not be necessary for an individual model; others may be contested. Indeed, not even all authors of this collection will accept all of them. To make this transparent, we have encouraged contributors to indicate briefly which of the features are necessary to support the arguments they provide, and which (if any) are incompatible with their account. For the sake of clarity, we provide the complete list here, very roughly ordered by how central we take them to be for “vanilla PP” (i.e., a formulation of predictive processing that will probably be accepted by most researchers working on this topic). More detailed explanations will be given below. Note that these features do not specify individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for the application of the concept of “predictive processing”. All we currently have is a semantic cluster, with perhaps some overlapping sets of jointly sufficient criteria. The framework is still developing, and it is difficult, maybe impossible, to provide theory-neutral explanations of all PP ideas without already introducing strong background assumptions. Nevertheless, at least features 1-7 can be regarded as necessary properties of what is called PP in this volume.},

@incollection{butz:2017structures,
abstract = {How do we learn to think about our world in a flexible, compositional manner? What is the actual content of a particular thought? How do we become language ready? I argue that free energy-based inference processes, which determine the learning of predictive encodings, need to incorporate additional structural learning biases that reflect those structures of our world that are behaviorally relevant for us. In particular, I argue that the inference processes and thus the resulting predictive encodings should enable (i) the distinction of space from entities, with their perceptually and behaviorally relevant properties, (ii) the flexible, temporary activation of relative spatial relations between different entities, (iii) the dynamic adaptation of the involved, distinct encodings while executing, observing, or imagining particular interactions, and (iv) the development of a – probably motor-grounded – concept of forces, which predictively encodes the results of relative spatial and property manipulations dynamically over time. Furthermore, seeing that entity interactions typically have a beginning and an end, free energy-based inference should be additionally biased towards the segmentation of continuous sensorimotor interactions and sensory experiences into events and event boundaries. Thereby, events may be characterized by particular sets of active predictive encodings. Event boundaries, on the other hand, identify those situational aspects that are critical for the commencement or the termination of a particular event, such as the establishment of object contact and contact release. I argue that the development of predictive event encodings naturally lead to the development of conceptual encodings and the possibility of composing these encodings in a highly flexible, semantic manner. Behavior is generated by means of active inference. The addition of internal motivations in the form of homeostatic variables focusses our behavior – including attention and thought – on those environmental interactions that are motivationally-relevant, thus continuously striving for internal homeostasis in a goal-directed manner. As a consequence, behavior focusses cognitive development towards (believed) bodily and cognitively (including socially) relevant aspects. The capacity to integrate tools and other humans into our minds, as well as the motivation to flexibly interact with them, seem to open up the possibility of assigning roles – such as actors, instruments, and recipients – when observing, executing, or imagining particular environmental interactions. Moreover, in conjunction with predictive event encodings, this tool- and socially-oriented mental flexibilization fosters perspective taking, reasoning, and other forms of mentalizing. Finally, I discuss how these structures and mechanisms are exactly those that seem necessary to make our minds language ready.},
